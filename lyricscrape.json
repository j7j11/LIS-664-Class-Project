I-I know you all too well.\nI said that we could kiss the past goodbye, but you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.\nYou can stay but shawty here I go...\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas? \nI'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it. \nI mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.\nI can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it. \nI am, still here with who I started with.\nThe game needed life, I put my heart in it.\nI blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit. \nCarried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.\nUh. I'm 23, with a money tree.\nGrowing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.\nIt's ironic, 'cause my mother was a flourist,\nand that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enourmous.\nIt's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.\nI avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.\nUh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.\nI'm trying to do better than good enough.\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.\nBut people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)\nYou promised me you would never change.\nYou promised me you would never change. \n\n[Verse 2]\nUh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.\nWhen 40 got some shit for me to snap on.\nNow that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.\nI'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.\nI heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.\nAnd I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.\nBut hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,\nthat I barley know at all and..\nPlus this woman that I messed with unprotected\nTexting saying that she wish she would've kept it.\nThe one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.\nMan I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holding on by a thread it's..\nLike I'm high right now, the guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.\nThat nothing really comes as a surprise right now,\n'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.\nBut people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)\nYou promised me you would never change.\nYou promised you would never change. \n\n[Verse 3]\nWell all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.\nThe other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.\nWhich made me question when I went missing.\nAnd when I start treating my friends different.\nMaybe it was the fast paced switch up.\nOr the two guns in my face during the stick up.\nMaybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.\nOr the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.\nI know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.\nI'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets. \nBurn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.\nCause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.\nDid I just trade free time for camera time?\nWill I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?\nI just need some closure. \nAint no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.\n\n\n\n\r\nif  ( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPod|iPad|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) \r\n  {\r\n     document.write('<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">'+\r\n  '<iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0px none; overflow:hidden;\" src=\"/web/20160510092512/http://adv.mxmcdn.net/br/t1.0/m_js/e_0/sn_0/l_7157113/su_0/tr_BWot6kEGYqQaipWJR0VZ6/n9hABlIWoelYl6ldibp9epmuN4J5tt+2yukRuWeVB1Git3/g+gte1+ZyNY///kgeBbBLdEMtoRCt5dgnCAPulHmyPUh3CxvVw1Fp7y+4z536gT6kPkmp2F+LOPa972XeCT9wCEtsR5/v61vinmpBM06+P0tQLhwLweVI3QvFZsjcpp0QPhQT4sqhf6787l4LZgNDrK7KRviCwPIZr6l5T1BQdKiEHuVIARcsPBCH4pLB0/8EBOUI0V9u2S+1watW/m7A0+jVf0D6SkXkhbHxJvEoMfnE/tNc/DrxjQgO4K9gIXrUsSViStjEdQ4QJDTA==/\" width=\"290px\" height=\"50px\"></iframe>'+\r\n  '</div>');\r\n   }\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Submit Corrections\n\n\n\nVisit www.azlyrics.com for these lyrics.\n\n\nThanks to Acclaimed for adding these lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-Z Lyrics\nD\nDRAKE Lyrics\n\n\n\n\"Thank Me Later\" (2010)\n\n\n\nFireworks\nKaraoke\nThe Resistance\nOver\nShow Me A Good Time\nUp All Night\nFancy\nShut It Down\nUnforgettable\nLight Up\nMiss Me\nCece's Interlude\nFind Your Love\nThank Me Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Search\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball.
