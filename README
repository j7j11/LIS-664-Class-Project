In order to run the scrapemaster.py. 
The user must pass three variables to the script.

The first variable is "artistlink".
This variable accepts the link to the artist's song page on Azlyrics.com. For example, "https:/www.azlyrics.com/r/rollingstones.html"

The second variable is called "linkend"
This variable accepts the ending of the url above that references the name of the artists. For example, "rollingstones" (with html removed)

The third variable is called "artistname"
This variable is used to tag each lyric with the name of the artist. For example, "The Rolling Stones"

The script is set to append to a JSON file. If you already created a JSON file with the scraped data. Running the script again would append to existing JSON.
